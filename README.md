# Hacknet For CMD (C++)
"Hacknet for CMD" originally by AhQiang and uses Batch for code, but changed to C++ by Skiawm91 for code now.
<br/>
## Some parts are different from AhQiang's "Hacknet For CMD"
All text to English.
### 1. Boot
I deleted all codes about wmic, because I didn't know how to convert to C++. 
<br/>
Then, wmic not exist in macOS.
<br/>
I also remove systeminfo.
## How to use?
1. Download from [Releases](https://github.com/Skiawm91/Hacknet-For-CMD-Cpp/releases)
2. Extract file.
3. Open "Hacknet"
4. Enjoy!
## I don't want to use release, but how to build?
